I developed an artificial intelligence system to solve the Knight Tour problem. 
Given an 8*8 board, the chess Knight piece must visit all squares, starting from any location. 
According to the rules, the knight must visit each square exactly once. Our algorithm should calculate the possible moves 1 or 2 steps into the future based on the userâ€™s selection.
In this game we Designed a GUI using Tkinter that allows the user to select the knight's starting position and the algorithm (1 or 2 steps into the future).
To print the order of each cell in which they are visited and animate the knight as it moves across the cells as shown.

1 - Turn based program
2 - Random funtion to implement chance
3 - Classes
4 - Methods
5 - Variables
6 - Loops
7 - Error key response
8 - Character choice
